_Nodes_ are building blocks which use connections to receive any data from one nodes, modify it, and send transformed data to another Nodes. Nodes may have zero or more inputs of different types, named _Inlets_ and zero or more outputs of different types, named _Outlets_. Nodes may have a body which may represent received data or even have some controls allowing user to change it though hidden inlets.
