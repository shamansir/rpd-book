# Terminology

At first, we'll define terms of node-based interfaces, the way RPD sees them, starting from the highest level (the _Network_) and going down till the lowest known level (the _Link_). If that's not very comfortable for you, you may do it in reverse direction, then please scroll down to _Link_ and then reach the top at _Network_.
